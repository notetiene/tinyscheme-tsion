    (*) The "libxdr" library is covered by Sun's license, which is included

        License: (i) you are free to use and modify the software and

Basically, you are free to use the software however you see fit, in commercial
or non-commerical applications.  I only ask that, if your time permits, you
report any bugs or portability problems you encounter.  Suggestions for
improvements and enhancements are welcome, but I do not guarantee I will act
upon them.
